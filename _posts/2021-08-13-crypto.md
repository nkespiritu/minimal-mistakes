*This is a final project for our Data Engineering class held from January to June 2021. This was created alongside [Adriane Amorado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianemikko/) and [Joanna Quinto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joannaquinto/).  For our final project, we were tasked to create an end-to-end data architecture that should have ticked off the following:*

1. *Input can be via an API endpoint that you will create or by watching a resource e.g., S3*
2. *Output must be an API endpoint and consumed by a dashboard/visualization or application*
3. *It must have the following:*
    1. *OLTP*
    2. *OLAP*
    3. *NoSQL database*
    4. *Data Lake*
    5. *Automated or periodic ETL/ELT*
4. *Provide data scientist access*
5. *Implemented on AWS. However, Redshift clusters should not be kept running and instead snapshots should be stored.*

*It was a tall order, and we had difficulty thinking of a specific use case that ticked off everything. Nonetheless, we made it work.*

## Objective

Because a lot of our friends in class were very much invested in cryptocurrency (at the time), we decided to create an end-to-end data architecture that pulls data from Binance and displays the data at the end.

## End product

As a proof of concept, we built a dashboard using AWS Quicksight which is connected to our Redshift cluster.

## In construction

We are currently collectively writing an article detailing our journey, a more distilled version of our final paper for the course. Stay tuned for updates on that one!
