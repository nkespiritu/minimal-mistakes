This is a final project for our Machine Learning class held from May 2020 to September 2020. This was created alongside my Term 2 learning teammates: [Ethan Casin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethancasin/), [DK Go](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielkristoffergo/), Karl Navarro, and [Daryll Tumambing](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daryll-tumambing/).  For this course, we were tasked to create a machine learning model with a business use case and [publicly present our findings](https://fb.me/e/1FSlFeg5t).

## Objective

Our goal is to gain insights as to what causes this low tipping rate and develop a machine learning model that would serve as the backbone of a recommender system that would influence customer tipping behavior. The motivation is to generate business value that would benefit both drivers and customers, the two main stakeholders of taxis and ridesharing companies. 

## About the data

Similar to our [use case on finding customer segments](https://nkespiritu.github.io/customersegments), we used the City of Chicagoâ€™s Open Data API on Transportation Network Providers (TNP) and taxi transactions. On this project, we limited it to only 2019 data.

*Community area's mean feature importance in regressor model.*

1. The best model for classification was Logistic Regression that had a test accuracy of 97.62%. Moreover, Ridge Regression with an accuracy of 77.07% and RMSE of USD 1.51 was the best regressor to predict the tip amount.
2. These models can impact passenger tipping behavior by determining if a passenger would tip and suggest a tip price to them. 
3. TNP platforms can fully maximize the models given the vast amounts of data they have and a set platform. Taxi industries, on the other hand, the need to modernize their business models must be done for the models to be leveraged properly.
