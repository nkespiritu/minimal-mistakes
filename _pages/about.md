I'm Nika, a data scientist experienced with Python programming. I enjoy translating data into concrete, actionable business insights, may it be through creating data visualizations, dashboards, creating models, or analyzing results. Talk to me about your upcoming projects!

Random tidbit: I spent *a week* at the AIM campus and I only briefly saw my classmates and professors, until the country went on lockdown starting March 15, 2020. I pursued my Master's degree during the height of the pandemic, because I've always know I've wanted to do this.
