I'm Nika, a data scientist experienced with Python programming. I enjoy translating data into concrete, actionable business insights, may it be through creating data visualizations, dashboards, creating models, or analyzing results. Talk to me about your upcoming projects!

## Education

I got my Bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of the Philippines Diliman in 2017. I then got a Master of Science in Data Science degree from the Asian Institute of Management in 2021.

I spent *a week* at the AIM campus and I only briefly saw my classmates and professors, until the country went on lockdown starting March 15, 2020. I pursued my Master's degree during the height of the pandemic, because I knew this is what I would have done regardless of the state of the nation.

## What I'm up to these days

I am currently:

:muscle: brushing up on SQL and R

:black_nib: writing some articles in the pipeline
