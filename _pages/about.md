I’m Nika, a data scientist experienced with Python programming. I enjoy translating data into concrete, actionable business insights, may it be through creating data visualizations, dashboards, creating models, or analyzing results. Prior to starting my data science journey, I spent 3 years in the renewable energy market, creating financial models and managing projects from development phase to commissioning.

**I’m currently looking for data scientist opportunities**. I’m also in the market for **freelance projects involving data visualizations and dashboarding solutions**. If you’d like to share an opportunity with me, please feel free to reach out to me or email me at nkoespiritu@gmail.com.

### What I'm up to these days

:black_nib: writing some articles about building an end-to-end data architecture and building documentation using Sphinx (all in the pipeline for now!) \
:cherry_blossom: continuously improving my website (if you have any tips or suggestions, let me know!)\
